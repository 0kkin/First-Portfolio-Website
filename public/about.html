<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Traditionally a Finance Major, I'm a young student eager to learn more about the world of software engineering</p>

<p>I currently have 2 years of experience as a Data Analyst, and I have been coding in SQL and actively working with out backend engineering team constantly.</p>

<p>This may be a bit simple for a website, but I'm hoping to improve as quickly as possible.</p>
